Hi!

I'm Alan, and this is my small corner of the internet. I don't blog very
often (obviously), but occasionally I'll write up some thoughts about
the world.

By day, I'm a research scientist at [CTRL-labs](
https://www.ctrl-labs.com/), where I live a dual life: I spend about
half my time investigating machine learning techniques for neural
interfaces while I spend the other half brigding our science work with
our software engineering teams.  Our goal is to build the first
real-world consumer-grade neural interface -- if we do our job right, no
one will ever use a mouse or a keyboard again in the nearish future.

By night, I'm a 20-something nerd who spends most of his time reading,
sleeping, and talking (usually while walking). I do a little bit of open
source work in my free time, but the bulk of my free time is spent
reading and engaging in long meandering conversations with friends.

These days, my technical interests are split between (applied) machine
learning, software systems (distributed systems and databases), and
compilers/programming languages. Physics was my first crush and
linguistics was my first intellectual love, but unfortunately I haven't
really kept up with either of them. Outside of STEM, I spend most of my
time reading history (generally "modern" history -- anything about the
long 19th century up until maybe 1950) with a smattering of popular
social sciences.
