Hi!

I'm Alan, and this is my small corner of the internet. I don't blog very
often (obviously), but occasionally I'll write up some thoughts about
the world.

By day, I'm a research scientist at [CTRL-labs](
https://www.ctrl-labs.com/), where we're building the first real-world
consumer-grade neural interface. At work, I split my time between
researching machine learning techniques for neural interfaces and
architecting our scientific modeling framework.  If we do our job right,
in 20 years no one will ever use a mouse or a keyboard again.

By night, I'm a 20-something nerd who spends most of his time reading,
sleeping, and talking (usually while walking). I do a little bit of open
source work in my free time, although the bulk of my free time is spent
reading and engaging in long meandering conversations with friends.

These days, my technical interests are split between (applied) machine
learning, software systems (distributed systems and databases), and
compilers/programming languages. Physics was my first crush and
linguistics was my first intellectual love (with brief flings with
economics and pure mathematics), but unfortunately I don't have much
time to keep up with them anymore. Outside of STEM, I spend most of my
time reading history (particularly those about the long 19th century)
and biographies.
